    <h2>Basic science of human genome informatics</h2>
        <p>Human genomics is at an exciting inflection point. Long-read sequencing platforms are rapidly approaching the cost per base pair of short-read technologies, while new informatic tools are democratizing telomere-to-telomere genome assembly. How best to organize these high-quality genomes remains an open question, but graph-based representations offer distinct advantages.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the vast existing datasets of genomes and exomes offer opportunities to represent more human variation through their translational reuse. This new multi-platform, multi-omic environment creates fertile ground for developing novel resources, analytical tools, and biological discoveries.</p>

        <h2>Translational science of informatic technologies</h2>
        <p>There is an urgent need to build a robust evidence base for the performance, particularly the noninferiority, of emerging informatic technologies. The lab focuses on demonstrating noninferiority, and where possible superiority, of new genome reference materials relative to established standards.</p>
        <p>Beyond genomics, we apply the same translational principles to conversational AI. Chatbots now occupy a prominent role in digital health and biomedical research. Our group designs ethically grounded, auditable chatbot systems to support informed consent and other critical decision-making contexts.</p>

        <h2>Empirical and conceptual bioethics</h2>
        <p>Genomics and bioinformatics continually raise new ethical questions, both practical and theoretical. Members of the LoTempio Lab are supported to explore the conceptual bioethical issues emerging from their own research projects, while applying empirical methodologies ranging from biostatistics to clinical trial design to study the ethics-technology interface.</p>
        <p>Our approach embeds ethical reflection throughout scientific workflows, from data governance and consent to the development of new informatic systems. This integration allows us to generate evidence about how ethics can be operationalized within rapidly evolving fields.</p>
